# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Remaining Strength of Schedule (SOS) feature will improve the existing `get_remaining_sos.py` functionality to provide comprehensive analysis of upcoming schedules based on power rankings. This feature will help fantasy baseball managers understand which teams face the toughest or easiest paths to the playoffs by analyzing opponent strength using the sophisticated power ranking system that considers all statistical categories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fantasy baseball manager, I want to see a detailed breakdown of my remaining schedule difficulty, so that I can understand my playoff chances and make strategic roster decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system calculates remaining SOS THEN it SHALL display both total difficulty score and average difficulty per remaining game
2. WHEN displaying SOS results THEN the system SHALL rank teams from hardest to easiest remaining schedule
3. WHEN showing schedule analysis THEN the system SHALL include team names alongside team numbers for better readability
4. IF a team has no remaining games THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully and exclude them from rankings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a fantasy baseball manager, I want to see opponent-by-opponent breakdown of my remaining schedule, so that I can identify specific challenging matchups ahead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing remaining schedule THEN the system SHALL show each upcoming opponent with their current power ranking
2. WHEN displaying opponent information THEN the system SHALL include opponent team name, power rank, and normalized score
3. WHEN showing weekly matchups THEN the system SHALL organize opponents by week for better planning
4. IF power ranking data is missing for an opponent THEN the system SHALL use a default neutral ranking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a league administrator, I want to see league-wide SOS analysis with statistical insights, so that I can understand competitive balance and playoff race dynamics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating league analysis THEN the system SHALL calculate SOS variance across all teams
2. WHEN showing competitive balance THEN the system SHALL identify teams with significantly easier or harder schedules
3. WHEN displaying insights THEN the system SHALL highlight the biggest SOS advantages and disadvantages
4. WHEN calculating statistics THEN the system SHALL provide percentile rankings for each team's SOS difficulty

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fantasy baseball manager, I want the SOS analysis to be automatically updated with current power rankings, so that the schedule difficulty reflects recent team performance changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating SOS THEN the system SHALL use the most recent normalized power rankings from the database
2. WHEN power rankings are updated THEN the SOS calculations SHALL reflect these changes automatically
3. WHEN the current week advances THEN the system SHALL recalculate remaining schedules accordingly
4. IF normalized rankings are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to basic power rankings with appropriate warning
